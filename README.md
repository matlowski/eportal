## WAHT IT IS? 
This is the backend of an e-learning portal. The portal clearly differentiates between students and teachers. During the account creation process, the user can choose the role they want to have in the system.
A teacher can browse courses created by other teachers, create their own courses, and edit them as needed.
A student can view the details of a course, decide whether they want to enroll in it, and solve interactive quizzes that are automatically graded.

All e-portal functionalities include:
* registering new users,
* login and logout system,
* password reset,
* editing profile information,
* viewing details of a course,
* browsing all available courses,
* solving quizzes within a given course,
* checking the results of solved quizzes,
* enrolling in courses,
* learning from courses,
* creating and editing courses,
